# The Basics

The best way to learn `asyncio` is by doing.

`asyncio` lets you write concurrent code in Python. When you make API calls or read files, your program usually waits. With `asyncio`, you can do other work while waiting. This makes your code faster.

Each chapter has a "Before you start" section that lists the relevant `asyncio` functions and classes. You can learn about these as you go.

If you want to understand how `asyncio` works first, take a look at this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/) or read the [official conceptual overview](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio.html#a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio).

For syntax and API reference, see the [official asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
