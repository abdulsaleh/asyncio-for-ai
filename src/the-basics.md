# The Basics

I believe the best way to learn `asyncio` is by doing. I hope that this guide will teach you as you build.

Each chapter has a "Before you start" sections which lists the functions and classes relevant for that chapter. You can learn about these as you go along.

If you want to understand how `asyncio` works under the hood first, read [Alexander Nordin's conceptual overview](https://github.com/anordin95/a-conceptual-overview-of-asyncio/tree/main).

For syntax and API reference, see the [official asyncio documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
