# Introduction



## How this guide is written


This guide have six interesting applications of asyncio:
* Async Model APIs
* Rate Limiters


Each application is split into a "challenge" which describes and a "solution" which shows one possible implementation.


Try to think about the challenge without looking at the solution first. Reserach suggest that people learn more when they struggle, even though struggle is uncomfortable and they feel they learned less.
